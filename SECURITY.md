## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate you taking the time to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you discover in this project. 
While this is primarily a learning repository for C/C++, security is still important, and your contributions help improve the quality and safety of the code.

How to Report a Vulnerability:

To report a vulnerability, please open a new issue on this GitHub repository. When creating the issue, please:

Title the issue clearly, for example: "Security Vulnerability: [Brief Description of Vulnerability]".
Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
The specific files or lines of code affected.
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
The potential impact of the vulnerability.
Any suggested mitigations or fixes (if you have them).
Do not include any sensitive information in the issue description.
If possible, provide a proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
What to Expect After Reporting:

Initial Acknowledgment: We'll do our best to acknowledge your report. Please remember that this is a personal learning project, and response times may vary.
Assessment: We'll review the reported vulnerability to determine its validity and potential impact.
Updates: We'll keep you updated on the progress of our investigation through the GitHub issue. You can expect an update at least once a week if the issue is still being investigated.

Resolution:
Accepted Vulnerabilities: If the vulnerability is accepted, we'll work to address it as soon as feasible. Once a fix is implemented and tested, we'll close the issue and may provide credit to the reporter (unless anonymity is preferred).
Declined Vulnerabilities: If the vulnerability is declined (e.g., it's not a security issue, it's already known, or it's outside the scope of this project), we'll explain our reasoning in the issue comments.

Thank you for helping to make this learning project more secure!!!!
